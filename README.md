# BitcoinPricePredictionLSTM

When a user accesses the root URL ('/'), the Flask app triggers the predict() function. The function then accesses other functions and starts getting historical Bitcoin price data from CryptoCompare API. The data is then preprocessed, scaled using the closing prices of Bitcoin, and prepared for the LSTM model training. Then the function constructs an LSTM neural network using Keras, and it is trained using the historical prices of Bitcoin. The function then utilises other functions to use the trained model to predict future cryptocurrency prices. The accuracy of the predictions is calculated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Finally, the predicted prices such as next 30 days forecast and accuracy percentage are converted into JSON format and returned as the response to the user's request. In case of any exceptions during the process, an error message is returned in the JSON response.
